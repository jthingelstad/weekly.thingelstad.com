# Archived one-shot scripts

Scripts in this folder were used to apply a specific cleanup once, synced to Buttondown, and are effectively frozen. They remain here as reference — patterns encoded in these scripts are useful when a similar problem recurs.

Do not re-run these against the current archive unless you explicitly intend to re-apply their transformation. Several (`convert_legacy`, `fetch_mailchimp`, `populate_missing_images`) depend on external data sources that may no longer exist.
