"""LLM-based faithfulness review of generated audio scripts.

Stage 4 of the audio pipeline (after build/validate/audio). Compares each
issue's body markdown to the generated script and asks Haiku to flag
*objective* transformation problems — content that's missing or distorted,
not subjective prose judgments.

Output is written to data/audio/script_review.json. Errors gate
`audio build --all` the same way validate errors do.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You audit transformation faithfulness between a newsletter body (Markdown) and the audio script generated from it.

Your only job: list specific transformation bugs. You are not judging prose, voice, listenability, pacing, or quality. You are not suggesting improvements.

Acceptable transformations — DO NOT flag any of these:
- Images, image alt text, image captions removed
- Link URLs removed (link titles preserved as plain text)
- Bare URLs removed
- Markdown formatting stripped (asterisks, brackets, backticks, underscores, italics, bold)
- Section intros added by the transform like "Now, the X section."
- Section closings added by the transform like "That's the end of X."
- Numbered cues added like "Link one.", "Link two.", "Journal entry three."
- Date stamps removed from journal entries (e.g. "Jul 12, 2024 at 8:13 PM")
- Liquid / Buttondown template tags removed (`{{ ... }}`, `{% ... %}`)
- HTML tags and HTML comments removed
- Inline emoji removed (☕️, 🎉, 🇮🇪, etc.)
- Unicode arrows removed (→, ⟶, ⇒)
- Reddit-discuss closing line removed (`_You can discuss... r/WeeklyThing..._`)
- "Would you like to discuss..." CTA removed
- Issue preamble added at the start ("The Weekly Thing, issue N. ...")
- Issue closing added at the end ("That brings us to the end of...")
- Date strings normalized to spoken form ("April 26, twenty twenty six")
- Years 2000–2029 normalized ("twenty twenty four" instead of "2024")
- Ordinals normalized ("21st" → "twenty first")
- Dollar amounts normalized ("$5.50" → "5 dollars and 50 cents", "$2.5 billion" → "2.5 billion dollars")
- "&" replaced with " and "
- "e.g.", "i.e.", "vs." replaced with their spoken forms
- Blockquotes wrapped with "Quote." / "End quote." cues
- Horizontal rules (`---`) removed
- Code fences and code blocks removed
- Cover-photo blocks (the "---" delimited block at the start of an issue containing an image and dateline) removed
- Decorative emoji-only lines removed
- Empty section blocks (header followed immediately by closing with no content) removed entirely
- Paragraphs reflowed onto single lines
- Multiple blank lines collapsed
- Headings rephrased into "Now, the X section." form
- Subject line emojis removed from the preamble

Flag (these ARE bugs):
- A substantive sentence or paragraph from the body that has no equivalent content in the script (excluding everything in the acceptable list above)
- Sentences in the script that are garbled, missing words, have broken syntax, or look corrupted
- Numbers/dates/dollar amounts/years that look transformed wrong (e.g. "2 dollars.5 billion" instead of "2.5 billion dollars")
- Names or proper nouns that look corrupted or cut off mid-token
- Leftover formatting cruft that should have been stripped (template tags, HTML tags, raw markdown syntax, bare URLs)
- Two paragraphs that got fused together with no separator
- A link title that's clearly truncated or has stray characters

Output: a JSON object with a `findings` array. Each finding has `severity` ("error" or "warning"), `where` (short quoted phrase locating the issue), and `what` (one sentence describing the objective problem). If nothing's wrong, return `{"findings": []}`.

Severity:
- error: the script has a real bug that affects audio fidelity (corrupted text, mangled numbers, dropped substantive content, leftover formatting cruft)
- warning: borderline / context-dependent (e.g. a paragraph dropped that COULD be intentional, ambiguous truncation)

Be conservative. If you're not sure something is a bug, don't flag it."""
