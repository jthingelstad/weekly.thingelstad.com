"""``compose-thesis`` — Eddy's 1–3 sentence editorial framing for the
issue. Fires at ``mark-built`` (the Build → Publish phase transition),
after the issue's content is frozen.

Reads the assembled ``draft.md`` (intro + sections in their post-reorder
sequence + outro) and asks Eddy for the editorial anchor. Writes the
result to ``atoms/thesis.md``. Downstream prompts —
``compose-meta:subject`` / ``compose-meta:description`` /
``compose-haiku`` / ``compose-cta`` — read this file as a ``## Thesis``
prefix in their LLM prompts so the four shipping jobs land coherently
on the same framing.

One-shot, no picker UX — runs in the background as part of the phase
transition. Jamie can edit via ``/eddy edit thesis`` to refine.

Best-effort: a failed write or empty Eddy response logs and leaves the
job result unsuccessful; ``mark-built`` keeps going (the phase
transition isn't gated on a successful thesis — better to ship without
a thesis than to wedge the Publish phase). Subject/description/haiku/CTA
prompts already degrade gracefully on a missing thesis.md.
