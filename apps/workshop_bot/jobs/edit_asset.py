"""``/eddy edit <asset>`` — pop a Discord modal pre-filled with the
asset's current content, write the edited result back to S3.

Edit doubles as create: when the asset doesn't exist on S3 yet, the
modal opens blank with an asset-specific placeholder hint and the
first submit writes the file fresh. No separate ``/eddy add`` /
``/eddy create`` verb — ``/eddy edit intro`` is the way to write the
intro for the very first time.

Editing the small per-issue atom files (``intro.md`` / ``outro.md`` /
``haiku.md`` / ``cover.json`` / ``cta-N.md`` / ``thanks-N.md``) used to
mean opening the AWS console or running a local script — friction
enough that WT348 had several "edit intro and reflect in the preview"
moments where the edit didn't happen.

Currently is no longer in this picker — the conversational + per-type
flow at ``/eddy currently …`` (and Eddy's #editorial dialogue) replaced
the static JSON edit.

Discord modals have a 4000-char per-input limit, which comfortably
fits every atom file (intro is ~1200 chars max; haiku ~80; the
cta/thanks bodies ~700; metadata.json is structured and not in this
flow). Bodies that exceed the cap are refused with a "use the S3
console" hint — better that than silent truncation.

This module deliberately does NOT touch the assembled documents
(``draft.md`` / ``final.md`` / ``buttondown.md``). Those are renders,
not authored text — they regenerate from the atoms.

After a successful write, the job optionally re-fires
``update-draft`` so the preview refreshes for atoms that flow into
``draft.md`` (intro / outro / haiku / currently / cover). Edits to
``cta-N.md`` / ``thanks-N.md`` don't auto-fire anything — they only
affect ``buttondown.md``, and that's a deliberate step (``/eddy issue
publish`` or post-final rebuild).
