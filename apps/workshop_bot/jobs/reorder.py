"""``reorder`` — Eddy's Notable/Briefly reorder pass.

Reads the current ``issue_items`` rows for the in-flight issue (Notable
+ Briefly + Journal), presents them to Eddy with stable synthetic ids
(``n1`` / ``b2`` / ``j3``), and asks for an **ordering-only** JSON
response:

```json
{
  "notable_order": ["n3", "n1", "n2", "n4"],
  "brief_order":   ["b2", "b1", "b4", "b3"]
}
```

Apply step is row mutations:

1. Validate the proposal shape and per-section permutations against the
   parsed synthetic ids.
2. Map each synthetic id back to its ``issue_items.id``.
3. Call :func:`issue_items.reorder` for Notable + Brief in the LLM's
   order. Journal is never reordered.
4. Re-render the three daily artifacts (``archive.md`` / ``buttondown.md`` /
   ``transcript/*.txt``) so the new ordering surfaces immediately.

Eddy posts to ``#editorial``: per-section was/now reorder map + a link
to the side-by-side ``final-proposal.html`` preview. Jamie reacts
✅ / ❌ / 🔄. On ❌ the existing row order survives. On 🔄 we re-prompt
up to :data:`_llm_job.MAX_REFRESH_ROUNDS`.

**Thesis lives elsewhere now.** This job used to also ask Eddy for a
1-3 sentence thesis and write ``thesis.md``. That moved to the
``compose-thesis`` job, which fires at ``mark-built`` (the Build →
Publish phase transition) — running over the *frozen* authored content,
not the in-flight draft. The phase transition is the natural place for
a framing that anchors every downstream Publish job.

**Other legacy that's also gone.** The name is from a retired era when
this job assembled an explicit ``final.md`` artifact, chose
``promotions`` (Journal entries to elevate), and proposed
``membership_blocks`` placements:

- ``final.md`` is gone — the three sibling renderers (archive / email /
  transcript) compose directly from row state + atoms; there's no
  intermediate assembled body.
- Promotions moved upstream to Jamie's micro.blog ``Featured`` tag.
- Membership-block placement is hardcoded in ``render_email`` via
  ``CTA_SLOT_POSITIONS``.

The slash command at ``/eddy issue reorder`` matches today's scope;
the internal trigger is ``reorder``.
