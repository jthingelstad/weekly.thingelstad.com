"""Exact-lookup helpers over the historical archive in workshop.db.

These are pure SQL queries against the ``issues`` and ``issue_links`` tables
(seeded by ``pipeline/one-shot/backfill_issues_data_layer.py`` for historical
issues, kept current by ``/eddy issue put-to-bed`` for each newly-shipped
issue). The agents use them through ``archive_lookup__*`` agent tools so a
question like "what was issue #200 about?" or "how often has Jamie cited
this domain?" becomes a sub-millisecond DB read instead of an LLM call.

All helpers are read-only and return plain dicts / lists of dicts so the
caller doesn't carry a sqlite3 row around. ``None`` is returned when the
identifier doesn't resolve (missing issue, missing domain) — never an
exception.
