"""Vision-generated alt text for journal and cover images.

One surface: ``generate_alt(*, image_url, context, caption=None)`` makes
one vision call (Sonnet) and returns a tight one-line description.
Returns ``""`` on cap exhaustion / fetch failure / vision failure. No
cache, no DB I/O — persistence is the *caller's* job (the journal alt
ends up on micro.blog via ``tools.content.microblog.fill_missing_alts``;
the cover alt lands in ``cover.json``).

``begin_run()`` resets the per-run vision-call cap; call at the top of
each ``update-draft`` so a single run can't fan out to dozens of vision
calls. The cap is configurable via ``WORKSHOP_ALT_VISION_CAP`` (default
15). Images that don't get a budget this run fill on the next sync.

Prompt guardrails: ≤120 chars, factual, no "photo of"/"image of"/"picture
of" preamble, no emoji, no quotes / ampersands / angle brackets (so it's
safe to write straight into an ``<img alt="...">`` attribute without
worrying about breaking the tag — defense in depth on top of the
``html.escape`` the caller does).
