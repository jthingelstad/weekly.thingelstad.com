"""Issue items — the row-backed model for in-flight content.

Replaces the byte-chunk model in :mod:`tools.content.chunks`. Each Notable
link, Brief link, and Journal entry in an issue is a row in the
``issue_items`` table. Reorders become ``UPDATE position``; promotions
become column flips; editorial comments anchor to ``item_id`` via the
``editorial_comments`` table.

The three rendering jobs all read from here:

- ``update-draft`` syncs upstream sources (Pinboard / micro.blog) into
  rows, then renders ``draft.md`` from rows + the file-backed atoms
  (intro / outro / cover / currently / haiku).
- ``create-final`` proposes orderings + promotions in JSON; the apply
  step calls :func:`reorder` and :func:`promote`. The LLM never touches
  bytes; identity comes from row id.
- ``build-publish`` renders ``buttondown.md`` from the same rows, splicing
  promoted items into their declared positions.

Editorial comments are written by Eddy's review pass and read by both
the HTML drawer (handle badges + copy buttons) and the Discord lookup
(``@eddy tell me about E349-N1``). Re-reviews supersede earlier
comments via ``replaced_by_id`` rather than deleting them.
