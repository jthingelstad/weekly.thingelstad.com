"""SQLite row-level helpers for the workshop bot.

The helpers are split into domain submodules and re-exported here so the
``tools.db`` package (and every ``db.<name>`` caller) keeps one flat,
stable surface. Edit the domain module, not this aggregator:

- ``_agents``          — agent outputs, link candidates, agent notes
- ``_subscribers``     — subscriber-event dedup + recent feed
- ``_discovery``       — Linky popular/sightings/to-read research, research-card
                         messages, feedbin dedup
- ``_followups``       — agent/Jamie commitments (the targeted heartbeat)
- ``_issues``          — issue windows + publishing-spine phase/cards
- ``_locks``           — job locks (single-asset serialization)
- ``_goals_campaigns`` — Patty's goals + Marky's campaign ledger
- ``_currently``       — per-issue ``## Currently`` values + canonical types
- ``_runtime``         — draft digests + agent-run telemetry
