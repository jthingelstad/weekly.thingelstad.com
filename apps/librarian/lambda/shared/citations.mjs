/**
 * Citation post-processing for the Thingy agent loop.
 *
 * The agent's tool results bubble up many candidate citations — far more
 * than will end up referenced in the final answer. The runtime hands the
 * full list here so we can keep only the ones the answer body actually
 * mentions, in the order they appear, with at most one citation per
 * issue number.
 */

/**
 * Return citations filtered + deduped against the answer body.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - Filter: drop citations whose `issue_number` is not referenced
 *     anywhere in `answer` (regex matches `WT\d+` or `#\d+`).
 *   - Dedupe: at most one citation per issue number; the first section
 *     seen wins (multiple tool calls can surface the same issue with
 *     different sections).
 *   - Order: sort by first-mention order in the answer body.
 *
 * Edge case: when the answer mentions no issue numbers at all (FAQ-only
 * response, out-of-scope refusal, etc.), the full citations list is
 * returned unchanged — the reader may still appreciate a "we looked at
 * these" footer.
 *
 * @param {Array<{issue_number: string|number}>} citations
 * @param {string} answer
 * @returns {Array}
